## üèõÔ∏è System Architecture

This frontend application is the primary client in a distributed microservice architecture. It does **not** connect directly to individual services. Instead, it communicates with a central **API Gateway**, which routes requests to the appropriate backend microservice.

This decoupled approach ensures scalability, resilience, and maintainability. The complete system is composed of the following repositories:

  * **Frontend (This Repo):** The Next.js client application.
  * **[API Gateway](https://github.com/Tushar7436/API-Gateway):** The single entry point for all client requests. It handles routing, authentication, and rate limiting.
  * **[Flight Service](https://github.com/Tushar7436/Flight-Service):** Manages all flight-related data, including schedules, availability, and pricing.
  * **[Booking Service](https://github.com/Tushar7436/Flight-Booking-Service):** Handles the entire booking lifecycle, from creation to payment and confirmation.
  * **[Notification Service](https://github.com/Tushar7436/Airline-Notification-Service):** Manages sending email or push notifications for events like booking confirmation, delays, etc.
